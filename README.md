html-line-colourer
==================

Colours each word separately in a given line using a list of possible HTML colours, then colours a second given line using a variable denoting which word-colour each word should have.

Basically, it allows you to automate the (HTML) colouring of lines. Think translations: the first line is coloured randomly, then the second line (a translation of the first) is coloured so that 'matching words' have the same colour.
